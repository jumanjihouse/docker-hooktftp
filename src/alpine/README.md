Alpine Linux
============

This directory contains source to build docker images based on
[Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/), a "security-oriented,
lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox".

I use [gliderlabs/alpine](https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine)
as the base image since it enables easy access to usable `apk` packages.
